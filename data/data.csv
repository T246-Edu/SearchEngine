VANESSA," This English name is usually chosen for its association with the butterfly genus. Its origin remains uncertain despite the claim that it was invented by Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels, for his intimate friend Esther Vanhomrigh. Supposedly he created it by combining the first syllable of her surname, Van-, with her first name, Esther, or the suffix -essa; but, if he created it at all, it is more likely that he based it on the Greek name Phanessa, substituting the ""Ph"" with the ""V"" from Esther's surname. Besides, the name may have existed before Swift's time. Phanessa is a feminine form of Orphic Phanes, the name of a primeval, hermaphroditic golden-winged god, meaning ""bring to light; make appear."" ",female,english,VANESSA@gmail.com
